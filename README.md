This repository contains R notebooks corresponding to analyses conducted on the Shale Network dataset of groundwater chemistry, accessible at https://doi.org/10.26208/DT5Y-5B37. To work with these codes, an input csv should be prepared from the Shale Network master file and the input lines should be updated accordingly. For more information on the dataset and its preparation, see https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.4c03371.
